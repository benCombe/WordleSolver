# WordleSolver

This Program is deigned to solve Worldle puzzles based on a user input.
The user is given a word by the program, the user then writes a string of 0's, 1's, & 2's into the input field

'0' : The letter does NOT exist in the desired word
'1' : The letter exists in the word BUT is in the incorrect placement
'2' : The letter is in the word AND is in the correct place

ISSUES:
- will not work for words that contain the same letter more than once (ie, sleep, soups, etc.)
- reset button does not work (at this time) 
    -  Must Exit and restart
